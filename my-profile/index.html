		<h1>Hi ! I am Valentina FAURE</h1>
		<img class="profile-pic" src="images/profile.jpeg" alt="Valentina FAURE">
		<p>
			I'm Valentina, originally from Paris where I lived for 25 years before moving to Marseille this year.
        <p>
			I'm a student in <strong> KEDGE Business School </strong>. I'm studying Marketing, a field that fascinates me for its ability to subtly influence people’s perceptions and behaviors. I love analyzing what makes a brand stand out, how it connects with its audience, and the strategies behind it all.

		<h2>Passions</h2>

		<h3>Travel</h3>
		<i class="fa-solid fa-plane" style="color: #8D735D;"></i>
		<p>
			I love discovering new places, not just for the landscapes, but for the whole experience—getting lost in a new city, seeing how people live, and finding spots that aren’t in the tourist guides.
		</p>

		<h3>Football</h3>
		<i class="fa-duotone fa-solid fa-futbol" style="--fa-primary-color: #8D735D; --fa-secondary-color: #bba781; --fa-secondary-opacity: 1;"></i>

		<p>
			Football isn’t just a sport to me, it’s an escape. I don’t just watch games—I feel them. And obviously, as a Parisian, PSG is the team I stand by, no matter what.


		<p>

        <h3>Psychology and Human Behavior (Mental health)</h3>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-brain" style="color: #8D735D;"></i>
        <p>
        	Understanding people fascinates me—how they think, how they act, why they react a certain way. Mental health is something I’ve had to deal with personally, so it’s not just a curiosity, it’s a reality I navigate every day.


         <p>

        <h3>Animals</h3>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-paw" style="color: #8D735D;"></i>
        <p>
        	Animals have always been a huge part of my life. I have two dogs and two cats. Beyond on my own pets, I try to help when I can, whether it’s through volunteering or just being there for animals in need.

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>

		<h3>Fashion</h3>
		<i class="fa-solid fa-shirt" style="color: #8D735D;"></i>
		<p>
			For me, fashion is part of my artistic expression. It’s not just about trends—it’s a way to showcase my creativity, play with styles, colors, and textures, and express my personality and mood.
		</p>
		<h3>Design, Creativity & Visuals</h3>
		<i class="fa-solid fa-palette" style="color: #8D735D;"></i>
		<p>
			Art and creativity run in my family—it’s a part of who I am. I love drawing, creating video edits, designing visuals, and even working on interior decoration. For me, aesthetics are a powerful way to express ideas and emotions, turning concepts into something tangible and visually meaningful.
		<p>

		<h2>Projects</h2>

		<h3>Event Planning</h3>
		<i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days" style="color: #8D735D;"></i>
		<p>
			Creating experiences that people actually enjoy and remember is something that excites me. I like thinking about how to make an event not just happen, but actually feel special.
		<p>
		<h3>Social Engagement</h3>
		<i class="fa-solid fa-handshake-angle" style="color: #8D735D;"></i>
		<p>
			Standing up for causes that matter is something important to me. Whether it’s raising awareness on issues like bullying or fighting for animal welfare, I believe in taking action, even if it’s just small steps.
